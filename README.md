# Welcome to my Portfolio

- üî≠ This is portfolio in Architecture and Materials Science.
- üñ•Ô∏è I used various modeling and rendering software such as CAD, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Rhino, SketchUp, Lightroom, Grasshopper, Lumion.
- üå± You can see my investigation about the hardness, water absorption, oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance of different materials.
- ‚ú® Also I processed the data with R and drew statistical charts to finalize the model.
- üì´ U can also find this portfolio on ISSUE: https://issuu.com/shucong/docs/shu_cong_portfolio

Architecture, as a fusion of science and art, strikes a delicate balance between logical ideation and aesthetic inspiration, harmonizing functionality with visual enjoyment. A perfect building, for me, extends beyond mere bricks and steel frames; it seamlessly integrates with its surroundings, caters to the inhabitants' needs, and embodies the builder's wisdom and thought process. Inspired by a neighbor who was an architecture professor, my fascination with architecture blossomed as he introduced landmark buildings, sparking my curiosity about the stories behind each structure.

My journeys, particularly in Hong Kong, where traditional street markets, European-style buildings like the Legislative Council Building, and modern skyscrapers stand side by side, fueled my passion. Captivated by the city's history, I began to explore photography to capture the essence of these structures and understand their unique characteristics.

During high school, I had the opportunity to contribute to an art project involving the model-building of my hometown, Nanjing. Collaborating with my teacher, I revisited Nanjing, documented distinctive buildings, and assisted in creating CAD floor plans for the model. Using unconventional materials like newspapers and glass bottles, I built the model, gaining insights into the evolution of architecture and the concept of space.

This experience heightened my passion for architecture, prompting me to recognize the importance of scientific knowledge in the field. Outside the school, as the publicity coordinator for the student union, I actively contributed to design work, honing my skills in software like Photoshop and SketchUp.

Deepening my exploration through books and online resources, I began to decipher architectural principles behind iconic structures. Concepts such as 'Form follows Function' by Louis Sullivan guided the construction of skyscrapers in Hong Kong, while the Central Market reflected the Bauhaus design principle. The Legislative Council Building emerged as a representative of Neoclassical Architecture in Asia.

In essence, my journey into architecture involves a blend of hands-on experiences, academic pursuits, and a profound appreciation for the fusion of science and art within the architectural realm.
